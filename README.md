## Metaprogramming

'Metaprogramming' is writing code that knows about code. Ruby has many methods for knowing about itself. While this doesn't come up as often as the 'normal' programming constructs, it gets used a lot when building utilities. ActiveRecord, for instance, uses a lot of metaprogramming to infer the names of tables, classes, and methods.

You've probably been using some elements of metaprogramming without even knowing it! Ruby methods like `.class` or `.methods` tell you what ruby knows about an object. Practicing with ruby metaprogramming can deepen your understaning of how ruby works 'under the hood', which in turn will help you think through solving 'regular' problems more effectively.

## Instructions

Practice metaprogramming in ruby with the [Ruby Metaprogramming Koans](http://rubyquiz.com/quiz67.html).

Run with `ruby metakoans.rb knowledge.rb`. There are many ways to approach the problem, but you might start by opening up the `Class` class and writing the `attribute` method.

Once you have solved the koans, check out the discussion on rubyquiz.com. There are many clever solutions to these problems, and the discussion itself is enlightening.
